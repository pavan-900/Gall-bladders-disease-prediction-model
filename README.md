# ðŸ§  Gallbladder Disease Risk Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict the risk of gallbladder-related diseases using integrated **genetic** and **phenotypic** datasets. The model helps in early diagnosis and assists healthcare providers in decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Gallbladder diseases often go undiagnosed in early stages. Early prediction using clinical data and genetic risk factors can significantly improve outcomes. This model aims to use patient features to estimate risk levels with high accuracy.
